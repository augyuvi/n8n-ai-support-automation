AI Support Ticket Automation (n8n)

This project is an end-to-end automation workflow built in n8n that streamlines how support tickets are handled.
The workflow receives incoming tickets through a webhook, processes the data, and uses an AI model to automatically classify the issue type.

Once categorized, the system sends instant team notifications via Slack, stores structured ticket data in Google Sheets, and triggers automated email confirmations to customers.
In addition, a scheduled workflow generates daily support reports, giving visibility into ticket volume and trends.

This project demonstrates practical experience with:

Event-driven automation

AI integration in real workflows

API orchestration across multiple services

Workflow design and error-resilient processing

Overall, the solution shows how automation can reduce manual work, improve response time, and create a scalable support operations pipeline.
